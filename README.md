# OpenGTS_RPi
Installing OpenGTS on a Raspberry Pi 3. After quite a few failed attempts, I have now installed and tested OpenGTS onto a Rapsberry Pi 3. Below is a complete installation method all done from the command line via an SSH connection using Putty.exe. The Raspberry Pi was initially set up using NOOBS, making sure that SSH is enabled. I hope you find this useful.
